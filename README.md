A project made for **APIs & Microservices Module** at FreeCodeCamp.

#### User Stories

1. I can submit a form that includes a file upload.
2. The from file input field has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
3. When I submit something, I will receive the file name and size in bytes within the JSON response

#### Screenshot

This is how the UI looks like:
